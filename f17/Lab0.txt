COSC 201 - Lab 0

In JAVA, create a single class called Lab0. In that class, create the following methods.

1.) Add3Ints (3 ints should be taken in as parameters) - calculate and return the sum of the three
integers passed in as parameters.

2.) Iterative Fibonacci (n should be taken in as a parameter) - calculate the nth value in the Fibonacci
sequence and return that value. For instance, if 6 was passed in as n, this method should return 8. You
may not use recursion to create this method.

3.) Recursive Fibonacci (n should be taken in as a parameter) - as before, calculate the nth value in the
Fibonacci sequence and return that value. You must use recursion to create this method.

4.) PrintSomeInts - bring in a file of integers named ints.txt that has an int value, one per line.  Print 
each int in binary, octal, and hexadecimal. (hint: printf)

5.) ArrayProcessing - given an array of integers passed in as a parameter, calculate the high, low, median, 
and mean of that array of ints and print those values.

In addition, create a main method (driver) that has a menu and allow the user to select one of the five 
methods above to execute. You should give an option to quit (option 0) and the program should continue to 
execute until the user enters the option to quit. 

For methods 1-3, printing of the result should be done only in the main method. For methods 4 and 5, the 
printing should occur in the methods. 

For method 5, ask the user for the size of the array and generate random ints to fill the array. For example, 
if the user enters 1000, you'll create an int array of 1000 random elements and then pass to the method.

Turn in via Blackboard by 11:59pm 9/5. Submit only Lab0.java. Do not submit any other files.
