Hi All!<br>
<br>
I wanted to provide a way for folks to get in touch with me now that I am
remote for the semester, in as many ways as possible. The regular ways: <br>
<br>
<b>Email!</b> - I'm usually pretty responsive to my email!<br>
<b>Slack!</b> - The CS program runs its own slack server, feel free to email me to
join, or message me there if you are already on the server!
<br>
<br>
Now for some ways to make an appointment, or even drop in and see if I'm
around! For the <b>drop in</b>, it'll be a Zoom meeting - if it's open, I'm around
and I'll let you in when I'm able (not meeting with someone else). For the
<b>appointment calendar</b>, just go to the link and make an appointment - it will
show up on my calendar and I'll send you a Zoom link for us to meet. Also,
my office hours are posted here with it's Zoom link.
