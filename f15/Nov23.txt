Quiz (until 12:20):

  You can place 8 Queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no
  Queen can capture any other Queen. Draw a configuration
  of Queens on a chessboard where this is true.

Graph representations:

  Let G = (V, E) be a graph

  V is a set of vertices
  E is a set of edges

Many classes of graphs:

  Paths
  Trees/Forest
  Caterpillar
  Cacti
  Complete graph - n vertices where each vertex has degree n-1
  
Properties:

  Directed vs undirected - directed edges with arrows indicating
    allowed movement
  Cyclic - does there exist a cycle from A back to A
  Weighted - cost to go along an edge

Representation:

  1.) Adjacency Matrix - 2 dimensional array of integers, n x n
      where n is the number vertices in my graph - |V|

      Each entry in the matrix i,j gives the weight (if there is
      one) between vertices i and j. For positively-weighted graphs
      0 indicates that there is no edge between i and j.

      [[0, 3, 0, 4, 0],
       [0, 0, 1, 0, 4],
       [0, 3, 2, 0, 2],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]]

  2.) Adjacency List - a 2 dimensional list. List of lists. Each list
      represents a source vertex, each element in that list represents
      vertices that are adjacent to that source.

      (vertex, weight)
      List G = List 1 -> (2, 3), (4, 4)
               List 2 -> (3, 1), (5, 4)
               List 3 -> (2, 3), (3, 2), (5, 2)
               List 4 -> null
               List 5 -> (4, 2)
