Queues - these are not implemented in Java as lists

FIFO structure

Anytime that you need to order objects and restrict access
based on "time"

Typical methods:

   void enqueue(T element)
   T dequeue()
   T getFront()

With Java 5, Queue was added as an interface that extends Collection

   T element() - getFront
   T remove() - dequeue

From the collection interface:

   void add(T item) - enqueue

How can we alter LinkedList to be a queue?
   LinkedList l;
   addFirst()           - enqueue
   removeLast()         - dequeue
   get(l.size-1) - getFront

How would we implement balanced symbol checker - just parens

Wrong Solution:
   int i = 0;
   Go through my string:
     if character == "("
       i++
     else if character == ")"
       i--

   if i == 0
     print success!
   else
     print failure!

Possible Solution:
   int i = 0;
   Go through my string:
     if character == "("
       i++
     if character == ")"
       i--
       if i < 0
         break;
   
   if i == 0
     print success!
   else
     print failure!

Balanced Symbol checker - compiler styleeeeeee
bad example: [ < ] >

One stack

if character = "(" || character = "[" ...
  push character
if character = ")" || character = "]" ..
  if top is the appropriate paired symbol
    pop
  else
    failure!

if a stack is not empty: failure!
