Need me to be a Reference?
<br />
No Problem!</span><span style="font-size:17px;"><br />

<p style="text-align:left;">Every year I’m asked to be a
reference or write recommendation letters dozens of times.
In general, I’m happy to perform this bit of service for my
students and alums. In the hopes of streamlining things and
allowing me to be as fast as possible in getting
recommendations/references out the door, I’ve provided some
general guidelines on this page. I’ve split this in to two
general categories: Letters and References. Letters refer
to letters of reference/recommendation that may be required
for REUs, NSE, grad schools, etc. References refer to
listing me as a reference for jobs and such.
<br />

<br />
I’m happy to serve as a reference for my students and
alums. There are some pretty basic things that I’d like
though:
<br />
<br />
1.) Be sure to send me an email to ask my permission. Give
me information about the position and company/school that
you are applying to in your email. Please don’t ask me in
person, I won’t remember that I gave you permission, and
that could lead to an awkward conversation with a potential
interviewer.
<br />
<br />
2.) If I don’t want you to list me as a reference, I
typically have good reasons. I have to be honest with the
folks calling me in order to make sure that my opinions
have the impact necessary to help folks get the positions
that they desire. If me serving as your reference would
have a negative impact on your application to a position, I
will politely decline the request.
<br />
<br />
3.) For reference, here is the contact information that you
should use:

4.) If they ask for a contact preference, please let them
know that I prefer to be contacted via email.
<br />
<br />
5.) Please follow these guidelines for background check
information as well.

I’m happy to write recommendation letters for my students
and alums. You should realize however that they are time
consuming and there can be a backlog especially at peak
times of the year (mid Fall and early Spring). To
facilitate your letter request (and to make sure you don’t
have an unhappy Alan) please follow the following:
<br />
<br />
1.) If you want me to send a batch of letters to a variety
of programs, that’s fine!
<br />
<br />
2.) I require 2 weeks of lead time before the first
recommendation letter is due. This means that you must have
all information to me (including submission link sent by
the program requesting the letter) 2 weeks ahead of the due
date. If you do not provide me this lead time, I will most
likely not write you the letter.
<br />
<br />
3.) I require 1 week of lead time before any subsequent
letters are due.
<br />
<br />
4.) Please request the letters of recommendation via email.
Include the following information:
<br />
<br />
* Name/Title of each program, including a link to the
program’s website (if it exists).
<br />
* Summary of due dates and submission guidelines, including
indicating if there are specific forms for any programs and
how to submit the letter.
<br />
* Unofficial transcript (if you are not my advisee)
<br />
* CS in-major GPA
<br />
* A current resume
<br />
* A list of any extracurricular activities you participate
in, including leadership positions held
<br />
<br />
5.) As with references, if I am not comfortable giving you
an overall positive recommendation letter, I will politely
decline to write the letter.</p>
