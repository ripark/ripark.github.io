title: About

I'm an associate professor of computer science at [St. Mary's College of Maryland](http://www.smcm.edu). My research areas are in recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in CS, as well as dynamic programming, self-stabilizing algorithms, and robotics.

Outside of "the office", I enjoy gaming of all kinds, cooking, photography, and rocking out with my two awesome daughters.
